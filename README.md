# Emissions-Model
A machine learning model for predicting the emissions of a car given some of its features. This was an interesting project, as it showed how a robust dataset can carry a model even on weak algorithms.

Worked on data preparation, Logistic Regression, and SVM Linear and RBF Comparisons. Methods for metrics and K-Folds validation. 
On the report provided proof reading, modifications, and reworked analysis of models.

#### Louis
Worked on SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
On the report provided much of the initial writing for results, most of the introduction and parts of the conclusions.

#### Omar
Worked on proof reading of report and colab file.
Worked on some of the cited works of the report.

## Dataset
Our dataset was found online from the following source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debajyotipodder/co2-emission-by-vehicles
This dataset pulls information from the Government of Canada's offical site. This presented some issues which are discussed in the paper.

## Report
The report can be found in this repository.
